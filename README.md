Homemade RC tank

## Description 

T84-120 Yatagan 
1/6th scale RC model

Two variants 
1) Electric
2) Electro-Diesel with turboprop

## Mechanical specs

### Propulsion

Chose from one of the two following options :

1) Electric
   Two AC or DC motors 

2) Electro-Diesel with turboprop
   Based on the Wren turboprop.
   Should produce a good amount of power, with two drawbacks :
   * consumption
   * noise

### Turret

The turret main movement is constrained around two axis :

* Rotation motor
* Elevation motor

### Others

* Lights
* Smoke
* Optics
* Dozer
* Coax MG

## Embedded solutions 

A gyro is placed on the main gun and obviously follows the rotation fo the gun/turret axis



## Software - Algoritms

### Turret stabilization simple algorithm

The hull can rotate on the three axis, depending on the terrain and how the vehicle moves.   

The gimbal, however is only allowed to work on two axis :
* azimuth angle (around z-axis)
* elevation angle (around y-axis)

Knowing the orientation of the gun and the
